1. AI (Artificial Intelligence)
Definition: Machines designed to perform specific tasks that normally require human intelligence.
Scope: Narrow / specialized.
Examples:
Chatbots (customer support)
Image recognition (facial unlock on phones)
Recommendation engines (Netflix, YouTube, Amazon)
Autonomous driving assistance systems
Key point: AI is good at one thing at a time but lacks general adaptability.
2. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
Definition: Human-level intelligence in machines. An AGI can perform any intellectual task a human can do.
Scope: Broad and adaptable across multiple domains.
Examples (hypothetical for now):
A system that can learn medicine, solve math, write novels, play instruments, all without needing retraining.
A digital tutor that adapts to each learner’s needs, emotions, and cultural background.
Key point: AGI = flexible, general-purpose intelligence, not restricted to one domain.
3. ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)
Definition: Intelligence that surpasses the best human minds in all fields — science, creativity, social skills, strategy, etc.
Scope: Beyond human ability, potentially self-improving.
Examples (theoretical):
Discovering new physics theories beyond human comprehension.
Designing advanced technology (medicine, energy, space exploration) at speeds humans can’t match.
Strategically solving global problems (climate, inequality, health).
Key point: ASI could reshape civilization — it’s both the greatest opportunity and biggest existential risk.
Quick Comparison Table
Feature	AI (Narrow)	AGI (General)	ASI (Superintelligence)
Scope	Specific task	Any human task	Beyond human capability
Current Status	Already exists (e.g. GPT, Siri, Tesla)	Not achieved yet	Hypothetical
Adaptability	Low (needs retraining)	High (learns across domains)	Extreme
Risk Level	Limited	Moderate–High (alignment issues)	Very High (existential risks)
⚡ In short:
AI = today’s narrow tools.
AGI = tomorrow’s human-level intelligence.
ASI = future superintelligence beyond us.
